      <h5> Friends </h5>
      <p> Outsidee of my family there is no doubt that my core group of friends have been the most influencial people in my life. My friends and I have been super close since a very young age. My groups of friends has always been considered the popular guys mostly do to the fact that we were the captains of every major sorts team that West Bend had to offer. We lead our school on and off the fields. We lead our pep rallies and our school wide scolastic programs. We were leaders in our community as well. All of have spent some amount of time employed by either habitat for humanity or the boys and girls club. It was a very life changing experience to be so close with those guys.

      <h5> East v.s. West </h5>
      <p> Going to the West Bend High Schools is a unique experience. There is two high schools in the same building. The school you go to is decided by the birthday of the oldest sibling in your family. If you are born on an even day you go to east and if born on an odd day you go to west. I had friends from both schools but my teammates obviously all went to east. During our football season there was no game bigger then the homecoming game every year which was West Bend East vs West Bend West. We have a huge spirt week all week leading up to the game and the crowd at the game gets close to 7000 people. Me and my buddies had the privelage to play in 3 homecoming games in which we played some of our best friends at West. In our 3 homecoming games we never lost to West. We blew them out sophmore and senior year and beat them in overtime junior year. At the end of the game "the bucket" is given the the winning team and it was a great feeling getting to hold that up every year. Those 3 games were 3 of the best nights of my life. We would all go out after the games and celebrate. We never had a winning record in a season but beating West every year made up for it.
