    	<h3> About me </h3>

    	<p> My name is Zack Fountain and I am an 18 year old from West Bend Wisconsin. I went to high school at West Bend East and was a 4 sport athlete. I participated in hockey, football, lacrosse, and baseball. After high school I attended Concordia University of Wisconsin for a semster and played football and hockey. I have 3 brother Drew (25), Alex (14), and Peyton (13). I was born in Grand Rapids Michigan were I spent the first half of my life before moving to West Bend. My dad owns his own construction company called All Phase Construction, while my mom is a math teacher at West Bend West High School. My older brother Drew graduated from DevCodeCamp and is working for Delta Defense in West Bend. Alex is a freshman at West Bend East High School. He is on the varsity hockey team as well as playing on the football team. Peyton is a 7th grader at Holy Angels Catholic School. He plays baseball, hockey, and football. My family is more then just my direct family. I have very loving and caring grandparents who make every effort to come visit us from Michigan to watch my sports and to support me in everything I do. I also have a dog who does not hesitate jumping in my bed and sleeping with me everynight. One of the most important people is my girlfriend Morgan. She is loving, supportive, and is always their for me.

        <p> Overall my family has been to many places and we are continuing to add to the list. We are hoping to add more places to our vacation list but it is begining to get alittle more difficult as we all have different schedules and are very busy. </p>
