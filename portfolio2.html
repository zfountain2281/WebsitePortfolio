    	</center>

    	<h5> Education </h5>
    	<p> My education started in Bryon Center Michigan where I attended Marshall Elementary School. When I came to West Bend Wisconsin I began school at McLane Elementary. After McLane I went to Badger Middle School. At Badger I was on the honor roll and was apart of Nathional Junior Honor Society. I also took a trip to Washington D.C. through the school and played badger basketball. </p>

    	<h5> Mclane Elementary School </h5>
    	<p> Most of my Elementary school was done at Mclane Elementary in West Bend Wisconsin. At Mclane I found some lifelong friends that I have today. Along with that I started playing sports more competitvely. While attending Mclane I qualified for two hockey state championships and competed in my first year of tackle football. I also began tutoring the younger kids at the school. In 4th and 5th grade I began to help the younger students in our school with homework and taught them how to read and write. At Mclane I created many memories that I still have today and that I can look back and laugh about.

		<h5> Badger Middle School </h5>
		<p> At Badger Middle I became a very dedicated and good student. At Badger I was on the honor roll every year as well as was accepted into National Junior Honor Society. I also sat first chair as a trumpet player in the band. My memories from our lunch table are endless. Me and my friends would do anything at lunch to get the attention of other people. We also got into a lot of trouble because of this and spent countless hours in detention or suspensions. Overall it was just middle school and we enjoyed every minute of it.

		<h5> West Bend East High School </h5>
		<p> High school to me was all about hanging out with my friends and playing sports. I lost my focus in the actual school part and I paid for it with my average grades. I spent every minute I had to be with my friends. We had a blast playing sports together and just spending time together. For the most part the guys that I played football, hockey, and baseball with are my best friends today. As far as the school part I graduted with honors my senior year and completed all of the engineering project lead the way courses. High school was 4 of the best years of my life and I would go back any day to take the field with my friends again.

		<h5> Concordia University Wisconsin </h5>
		<p> Although my time at Concordia was pretty short I enjoyed it while I was there. I had a declared major of nursing so I took alot quite a few science classes. I was a sub par student because I spent all of my time focussing on sports. I played both football and hockey and they are sports that run back to back so my whole first semster was lifting, watching film, and playing mhy respective sports. Overall I had a ton of fun playing and on the weekends at the football house. I met a couple of guys who I still am close with even though I don't go there anymore. As I have started this bootcamp I am realizing that Concordia just wasn't the place for me. I don't regret going there by any means but I am happy to be moving on.
